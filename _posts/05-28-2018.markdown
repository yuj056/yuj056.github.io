# Conclusion of first period of work
## 1. About me 
I am Yuanjie, a Ph.D. candidate student in Mechanical and Aerosapce Engineering Department at University of California, San Diego. My research mainly focuses on computational studies of reactive flow. It's my pleasure to accepted by GSoC. Currently,I am working on the project called Implement a Plug Flow Reactor Model with Surface Chemistry. 
## 2. About the project
Tubular flow reactors have been widely applied to chemical process industries for a long time. The general governing equations for reacting flow involve complex information, i.e. transport, thermodynamics and kinetics properties, in order to simplify the problem and reduce the dimensionality,  plug flow reactor is developed as a acceptable idealized model. The plug flow reactor assumes that no mixing in axial direction (maximize reactant conversion) and perfect mixing in transverse direction (avoid mass-transfer limitation). In Cantera, the existing plug flow reactor model does not allow for surface reactions. The first step of this project would be to derive a general set of governing equations for such a model. The implementation of the solver for this model would then be the first application of the SUNDIALS IDA solver for differential-algebraic equations within Cantera.
## 3. The work has been done
* The detailed derivation of governing equations and algebraic constraints can be reached via [my first week report.](https://github.com/yuj056/yuj056.github.io/blob/master/Week1/yuj056_github_io.pdf). 
* Lots of research on Sundials IDA solver has been done for differential and algebraic equations (DAE) solving. To simplify the problem, isothermal tube with laminar flow reactor model has been tested at first comparing with the The results have been
