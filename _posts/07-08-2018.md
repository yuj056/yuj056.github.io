# Second period of work
## 1. The work done in the first period
First let's quick review what I implemented in the first period of work. The governing equations and algebraic constraints are derived for the 1D plug flow with surface chemistry. SiF4 and NH3 isothermal reactions are used to valify the computational model, where nonlinear equation solver and IDA solver are used to calculate the initial values at the entrance of the tube and determine the variables varies along the the flow direction, respectively. The problem is that the IDA solver cannot be convergent last time.
## 2.  
Therefore, the goal for this period of work is obvious that I need to figure out the reason lead the solver divergent
