# Final period of work
## 1. Use a single IDA solver rather than the nested IDA solvers
In the previous period of work, the nested solvers (CVODE + IDA) are used to calculate the DAE system, where IDA solver is applied to calculate the site fractions of the surface species at the steady state and CVODE is used to simulate the variables (u, &rho;, p, Y<sub>k</sub> ) varing with the flow direction. However, after testing the isothermal reaction of SiF<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>
