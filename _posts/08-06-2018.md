# Final period of work
## 1. Disadvantages of nested CVODE + IDA solvers
In the previous period of work, the nested solvers (CVODE + IDA) are used to calculate the DAE system, where IDA solver is applied to calculate the site fractions of the surface species at the steady state and CVODE is used to simulate the variables (u, &rho;, p, Y<sub>k</sub>) varing with the flow direction. However, after testing the isothermal reaction of SiF<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, several problems show up: 1. In order to use CVODE solver, the equation of state need to be differentiate, which caused some drift problems and increase the simulation error. 2. The nested solvers work bad when the outer CVODE solver is an implicit one.
## 2. Use a single IDA solver rather than the nested solvers
Instead, we use a single IDA sovler to deal with our DAE system. The initial values of differential and algebraic variables are given and calcualted using `advance_to_coverages` respectively. Both differential and algebraic variables varing with the flow direction are calcualted inside the residual function of IDA solver. Considering the problem from the large value that I am getting for dp/dz for the pressure at the time of failure and to avoid inconsistencies, the residual equation for the equation of state (EoS) just changes to be `result = gas.pressure - vec_pressure`, which offloads the EoS calcualtion to Cantera, and has the added benefit of not necessarily assuming an ideal gas. The following screenshot shows the residual function of the IDA solver, the details can be found [here](https://github.com/yuj056/yuj056.github.io/blob/master/model/1D_pfr_surf_IDA.ipynb)
