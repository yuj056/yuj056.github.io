# Final period of work
## 1. Disadvantages of nested CVODE + IDA solvers
In the previous period of work, the nested solvers (CVODE + IDA) are used to calculate the DAE system, where IDA solver is applied to calculate the site fractions of the surface species at the steady state and CVODE is used to simulate the variables (u, &rho;, p, Y<sub>k</sub>) varing with the flow direction. However, after testing the isothermal reaction of SiF<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, several problems show up: 1. In order to use CVODE solver, the equation of state need to be differentiate, which caused some drift problems and increase the simulation error. 2. the nested solvers work bad when the outer CVODE solver is an implicit one.
## 2. Use a single IDA solver rather than the nested solvers
