# Second period of work
## 1. The work done in the first period
First let's quick review what I implemented in the first period of work. The governing equations and algebraic constraints are derived for the 1D plug flow with surface chemistry. SiF4 and NH3 isothermal reactions are used to varify the computational model, where nonlinear equation solver and IDA solver are used to calculate the initial values at the entrance of the tube and determine the variables vary along the the flow direction, respectively. The problem is that the IDA solver cannot be convergent last time.
## 2. Problem shooting
Therefore, the goal for this period of work is obvious that I need to figure out the reasons lead to the solver divergent. After the Skype call with my mentors to discuss the problem in my code at the beginning of the second period of work, I was suggested that: 1. use a one step adsorption reaction to check the IDA solver 2. do not use `advance_to_coverage` to calculate the site fraction inside the residual function, solving the trasient site fraction equation and getting the steady state site fraction inside the residual function instead.
